Rumblt was a group project for school, and is a clone of the site Tumblr. Recently I've begun updating this repo again to add features and to clean up/fix things done incorrectly (learned a lot in 4 years!).

This readme will be updated with the project details, what will be needed for the env, and the database schema.
